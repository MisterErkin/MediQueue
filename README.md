# MediQueue: Queue Management System

MediQueue is a lightweight and easy-to-use Queue Management System designed specifically for service sectors like hospitals and clinics. This project provides two main interfaces: **Patient Side** for ticket registration and **Admin Dashboard** for queue management.

---

## Features

### Patient Side
- **Ticket Generation**: Patients can select a department and enter their name to generate a ticket.
- **Real-Time Queue Display**: The patient interface shows the real-time queue of waiting patients.
- **Department Selection**: Patients can choose from a dynamic list of departments defined by the admin.

### Admin Dashboard
- **Queue Management**: Admin can view the list of waiting patients with options to mark them as served or remove them.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Admin can reorder patients in the queue by dragging and dropping.
- **Dynamic Department Management**: Add or remove departments dynamically, and the patient side reflects these changes in real-time.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Admin can see updates to the patient list in real time.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
